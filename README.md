#Scarid

Scarid is an experimental cache written in Scala. It is currently working as a single server instance.
Further development will bring fully distributed architecture. Multiple server nodes work will masterless.
Data will be partitioned and replicated on different nodes for fully scalable architecture.

Contributions are welcomed, let me know on twitter @pisfly.
